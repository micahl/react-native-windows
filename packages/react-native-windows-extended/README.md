# react-native-windows-extended

This module is somewhere to put components that shouldn't be part of react-native-windows, which should be kept to a minimum (think just matching RN's lean-core functionality).

This provides a place where components can be explored without affecting the core implementation.

The APIs provided by this package will likely be relatively unstable.
